# Tunisian Weather Analysis

## Introduction:

As part of our project, we will examine Tunisian weather data covering the period from 1983 to 2022 to better understand the various factors influencing weather behavior.

This project encompasses the analysis of temperature, wind, and precipitation, with the ultimate goal of predicting temperature values for the coming years.
